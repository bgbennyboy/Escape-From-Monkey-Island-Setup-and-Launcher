# Escape-From-Monkey-Island-Setup-and-Launcher
There are two parts to this project; an installer and a launcher program. A replacement installer (setup program) for Escape From Monkey Island. The installer that comes with the game can be problematic with newer versions of Windows and refuses to work at all on 64 bit Windows. An improved version of the launcher program that shipped with Escape From Monkey Island, it has a number of features not present in the original launcher.
