# Escape-From-Monkey-Island-Setup-and-Launcher
There are two parts to this project; an installer and a launcher program. 

EMI Setup:
A replacement installer (setup program) for Escape From Monkey Island. The installer that comes with the game can be problematic with newer versions of Windows and refuses to work at all on 64 bit Windows.
It performs a full install of the game and comes with my Escape From Monkey Island Launcher – which adds extra features beyond those in the game’s original launcher.

EMI Launcher:
An improved version of the launcher program that LucasArts shipped with Escape From Monkey Island, it has a number of features not present in the original launcher:

* Can run EMI in windowed mode.
* Can make EMI run in a higher resolution
* Can patch the game so the cds don’t need to be in the drive to play (on all versions of the game except Italian).
* Can automatically download and install the V1.1 update patch for all language versions of EMI.
* Works on both 32 bit and 64 bit versions of Windows and has been tested on XP through to Windows 10.
